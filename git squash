GIT SQUASH ->  Combines multiple commits into a single commit. This is useful for cleaning up your commit history by merging several small changes into one meaningful change.  

Example: Let’s say you have these three commits on your feature branch:
Commit 1: Added a button.
Commit 2: Fixed the button color.
Commit 3: Adjusted the button size.

Before squash:-
feature: F1---F2---F3

Run "git rebase -i HEAD~3" and change the second and third commits to squash, you’ll combine them into one. Then after squash:
feature:  F1'
