GIT REBASE -> Integrating commits from one branch into another, maintaining a linear history.

Imagine we do have two branches main and feature with commits like below:
main:    A---B---C
feature:       D---E

Run command "git rebase main" while on feature branch that means feature commits will on top of main branch like below:
main:    A---B---C---D'---E'
